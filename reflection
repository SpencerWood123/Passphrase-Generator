For the most part this was quite a diffficult assignment. Since there was no backbone structure for us to work off, it was hard to figuere out how to code the dice rolls memory and storing the words. Me and my peer Raunak collaborated on the assignment because it was a large task to do without clear instruction on how to do it. We found a few articles from places such as python.org to help us get a better understanding. I also found some more indepth articles about generating dice rolls in a passphrase. Overall, I wish for future assignments there would be more structure because it was very difficult without help.
